          well, for some reason i love reading short news, like from those news websites, but recently i have seen a lot, and when i say a lot, it's A LOT, of fake titles, like "my chemical romance is back on the lines" then you click to read and it's a lot of paragraphs talking about something that has nothing to do with the title, like "what is my chemical romance" or "the band members" AND IT GET'S EVEN WORSE LIKE "how the band was created" and then at the END, the last topic is "my chemical romance is back?" and it's a FUCKING TEXT talking about something gerad way said 1323384 years ago.<br>
          like, why don't you just put a title that matches with the post/text aaaghhrrrr
