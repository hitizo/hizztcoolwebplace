  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">You're Sherlock Gnomes, one of the best detectives from your region. There's always beautiful ladies calling you with cases to be solved, but now you find yourself in a not-so-pleasing situation; you took the wrong medication and accidentally slept while working and now you are locked inside your office. For some reason, the door won't open. What will you do now?</p>
  <br><br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Call your great friend Consalhes</b>
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consalhes: Hello?
Sherlock? Is that you?<br>
Sherlock: Hello Consalhes, it is I, your great friend Sherlock Gnomes. How are you doing?<br>
Consalhes: I'm doing just fine, but why did you call me?<br>
Sherlock: I bring awful news, Consalhes...<br>
Sherlock: And by awful news, I don't mean just bad news, I mean truly dreadful news...<br>
Consalhes: Huh? What happened???<br>
Sherlock: I'm locked inside my own office, Consalhes. In my own office.<br>
Consalhes: Do not worry, I'm coming to save you.</p><br>
<br>
**callÂ ends**
  <br><br>
  There's nothing you can do now, except just wait..
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and wait...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
wait. .  .   .    .      .       .         .            .              .<br>
  <br><br>
  **trim trim trim**<br>
  <br>
The phone rings.<br>
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Pick up the phone.</b>
  <br><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Sherlock: Hello, Sherlock Gnomes here.<br>
???: Sherlock gnomes...<br>
???: Your time is running out, Sherlock. I could be ready to kill you at any time.<br>
???: That was a warning. Goodbye, Sherlock.</p>
<br><br>
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??? You need to get out of here as soon as possible. A chill runs from the bottom of your anus to the top of your spine. You are <u>really</u> scared. What will you do now??
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Look at the other side of the room.</b>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/003.gif">
<br><br>
OF COURSE!! How could you forget about the <b>other side of the room</b>, your favorite side! Here, you have a portrait of your favorite clown! Birits Clown! He was a great man, you miss him..<br>
<br>
You're pretty sure there's something behind the portrait of your great friend Birits Clown.
But what could it be...
You can't remember exactly what it was...
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Look behind the portrait.</b>
<br><br>
you will...<br> 
move it....<br>
just a little bit.....<br>
<br>
DONE!<br>
There's a tunnel behind the portrait! How could you forget about your good old 'tutu'!!
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Crawl your way out of the tunnel.</b>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/0004.gif">
<br><br>
It's a bit tight, but you can do it with just a little effort...<br>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/005.gif">
<br><br>
You finally reach the end of the tunnel and it leads you to another room, and this room is absolute shit! There's only a chest in here, you hope that you get something good from it...
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Open the little chest.</b>
<br><br>
There is only (1) folded piece of paper.<br>
At the top, it's written "To my great friend Sherlock Gnomes"
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/006.gif">
<br><br>
<b>> Sherlock: Open it.</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
From: Birits Clown<br>
To: Sherlock Gnomes<br>
<br>
Hello, my friend Sherlock Gnomes. It's me, your great friend Birits Clown. If you're reading this, it means that you stopped being a fucking dumbass and decided to leave your fucking office or atleast tried to, but I just want you to know one thing, remember Gigex? Well, he's in jail now, but when you read this, he will probably be free at the time, and just so you know, he's fucking mad at you. Get the fuck out of there right now and DO NOT CALL CONSALHES TO HELP YOU!!!!  
</p><br>
<br>
Damnit. You almost forgot about Consalhes. You wanted to warn him, but it's probably too late now...<br>
<br>
You wonder if Consalhes is safe right now, or maybe....
