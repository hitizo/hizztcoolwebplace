  <br><br>
  <p style="text-align: center;">You're Sherlock Gnomes, one of the best detectives from your region. There's always beautiful ladies calling you with cases to be solved, but now you find yourself in a not-so-pleasing situation; you took the wrong medication and accidentally slept while working and now you are locked inside your office. For some reason, the door won't open. What will you do now?</p>
  <br><br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Call your great friend Consalhes</b>
  <br><br>

  <br><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">Consalhes: Hello?
Sherlock? Is that you?<br>
Sherlock: Hello Consalhes, it is I, your great friend Sherlock Gnomes. How are you doing?<br>
Consalhes: I'm doing just fine, but why did you call me?<br>
Sherlock: I bring awful news, Consalhes...<br>
Sherlock: And by awful news, I don't mean just bad news, I mean truly dreadful news...<br>
Consalhes: Huh? What happened???<br>
Sherlock: I'm locked inside my own office, Consalhes. In my own office.<br>
Consalhes: Do not worry, I'm coming to save you.</p><br>
<br>
**call ends**
  <br><br>
  There's nothing you can do now, except just wait..
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and wait...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
wait. .  .   .    .      .       .         .            .              .<br>
  <br><br>
  **trim trim trim**<br>
  <br>
The phone rings.<br>
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Pick up the phone.</b>
  <br><br>
<p style="text-align: left;">
Sherlock: Hello, Sherlock Gnomes here.<br>
???: Sherlock gnomes...<br>
???: Your time is running out, Sherlock. I could be ready to kill you at any time.<br>
???: That was a warning. Goodbye, Sherlock.</p>
<br><br>
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT??? You need to get out of here as soon as possible. A chill runs from the bottom of your anus to the top of your spine. You are <u>really</u> scared. What will you do now??
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Look at the other side of the room.</b>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/003.gif">
<br><br>
OF COURSE!! How could you forget about the <b>other side of the room</b>, your favorite side! Here, you have a portrait of your favorite clown! Birits Clown! He was a great man, you miss him..<br>
<br>
You're pretty sure there's something behind the portrait of your great friend Birits Clown.
But what could it be...
You can't remember exactly what it was...
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Look behind the portrait.</b>
<br><br>
you will...<br> 
move it....<br>
just a little bit.....<br>
<br>
DONE!<br>
There's a tunnel behind the portrait! How could you forget about your good old 'tutu'!!
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Crawl your way out of the tunnel.</b>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/0004.gif">
<br><br>
It's a bit tight, but you can do it with just a little effort...<br>
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/005.gif">
<br><br>
You finally reach the end of the tunnel and it leads you to another room, and this room is absolute shit! There's only a chest in here, you hope that you get something good from it...
<br><br>
  <b>> Sherlock: Open the little chest.</b>
<br><br>
There is only (1) folded piece of paper.<br>
At the top, it's written "For my great friend Sherlock Gnomes"
<br><br>
  <img src="https://file.garden/ZLptrSeVhBA68gx4/myWebsites/hizztcoolwebplace/sherlock%20gnomes/006.gif">
<br><br>
<b>> Sherlock: Open it.</b>
<br><br>
